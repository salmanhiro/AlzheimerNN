### Some neural network joys using unorthodox approach.

### Caution: not to be used for competition or academics, unless you want to be a meme material.

Well, this is my interesting project (and also maybe I hope it will be a discovery), for using strange way in treat neural network. 

## 1. Why we are racing for smartest AI?

As we know, we live in community, with every individuals facing a weakness. To specify, there is some kind of disorder named brain problem, or maybe in another term, some diseases affect the brain.


In the middle school, I am the one of the most stupid students in class, ranked 34th out of 36. Got exam score of 10/100, which means I am far too inferior from the simple machine learning, even my in-class exercise who had 50% accuracy is far smarter than me. In the world full of intelligent system, it would not be colorful if all of them are smart.
